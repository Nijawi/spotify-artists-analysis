In this project, I attempt to answer the questions **"What makes a song popular on Spotify?"**.

I work with the [Top Spotify Tracks of 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-tracks-of-2017) dataset downloaded from Kaggle. It is loaded in *Spotify-Audio-Features.csv* file.

The dataset contains the audio features for Spotify's 100 top tracks of 2017. The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the `spotipy` Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.
